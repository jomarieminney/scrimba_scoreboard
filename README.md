# scrimba_scoreboard
Javascript project on Scrimba to create a basketball scoreboard

I'm learning Javascript, but properly - so that I can learn React (properly).
This repository is for the second Javascript project in the free Scrimba 'Learn Javascript' course.

You can find the course here: https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript/
